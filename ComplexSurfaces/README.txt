This is a rewrite of the OSG example osgshaders to demonstrate the Complex Surfaces shaders, grass, dirt and concrete.

The framework of the shaders was built in RenderMonkey, staring with their Shaded Bump example. The shaders incorporate fBm noise code by Stefan Gustavson ITN-LiTH (stegu@itn.liu.se) used by permission (see source for terms). The bump aplitude to normal code is by Steve Koren. The shaders were developed by Chris 'Xenon' Hanson, xenon@alphapixel.com for Skew Matrix and ISU.
